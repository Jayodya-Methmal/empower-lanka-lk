# empower-lanka-lk
The Empower Lanka project, an initiative to provide an all-in-one platform for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to network, educate themselves on, and develop Technology Stack for Web Development: ReactJS, Node.js, Express, MySQL

The purpose of our system is to create a comprehensive platform that caters to struggling entrepreneurs amidst the economic crisis and supports those aiming to initiate new businesses during this critical period. Our primary focus is on developing functionalities that assist both emerging and established entrepreneurs in selling their products and services. Additionally, our platform provides an environment for entrepreneurs to interact with one another, fostering mutual benefits, and facilitating the acquisition of professional awareness and knowledge relevant to their businesses.

Goals
1. Provision of Professional Consultation:
Registered entrepreneurs can access professional consultation through our platform via a searchable consultation page, facilitating the hiring of experts at a reasonable fee. This empowers entrepreneurs, promotes growth, and provides effective solutions to their challenges.
2. Addressing Interaction and Engagement:
To enhance collaboration among entrepreneurs and foster mutual benefits, we focus on two components:
a) Facilitating Collaboration:
Our platform connects entrepreneurs with similar interests, allowing them to collaborate and enhance their businesses. For example, a coconut plantation owner can collaborate with a coconut milk processing factory owner to add value to their products. By fostering such connections, our platform facilitates business expansion and leverages shared interests effectively.
b) Direct Listing of Products and Services:
Entrepreneurs can directly list and categorize their products and services on our platform for convenient customer access. Additionally, registered distributors can connect with the system to fulfill delivery orders through our existing e-commerce functionality. This direct purchasing model benefits both customers and entrepreneurs.

Design and Development:
The design specification includes determining the functions to fill in the gaps we choose to address. We are designing role-based registration and logins so specific categories of users can access features, respectively.
As an example, entrepreneurs were identified as the primary users of our platform. We divided them into two categories, i.e., excisting, and start-up entrepreneurs, so that features could be optimized for them.
Accordingly, senior, and small-scale entrepreneurs should have access to functions such as consultation, networking, a list of products and services, and a blog page. However, all functions except listing products are available to startup entrepreneurs who want to start new businesses. Likewise, we need to conduct the correct systems thinking while tapping into relevant functions to solve problems that we are only focused on.
